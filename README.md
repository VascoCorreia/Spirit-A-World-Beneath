  <p>
    In the year 74*, a young Scottish boy named Rory Graham stumbled upon a twist of
    fate that would change his life forever.
  </p>
  <p>
    Growing up as a peasant in Scotland, Rory and his illiterate mother worked tirelessly
    on their neighbor's onion field just to make ends meet. But no matter how hard they
    worked, they never seemed to have enough food or warmth to sustain themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rory's father, Henry Graham, had long abandoned the family in his relentless pursuit
    of treasure and ancient passages in the Scottish highlands. Though he shared some
    memories with his son before his departure, Henry's passion for treasure ultimately
    consumed him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Desperate to find a clue to his father's whereabouts, Rory searched his father's study
    for any sign of his location. Amid the clutter, he stumbled upon a beautiful necklace
    adorned with a dazzling blue stone.
  </p>
  <p>
    Curious as he has always been, Rory puts on the necklace and contemplates its
    origins. Where did it come from? Why would his dad own such a precious piece when
    the family had been struggling ever since?
  </p>
  <p>
    As all of these thoughts wander through the boy’s mind, the blue stone slightly lights
    up and levitates, pulling Rory to one of the room’s corners. There, under an uneven
    floorboard, he finds a secret passage that was once used by his dad to descend into
    the tunnels. As Rory was inspecting the old passage, the wood boards collapsed,
    leading him to fall into the tunnels and trapping him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Taunted by the fall, Rory is stunned by the existence of the tunnels right where he
    always lived. They seem haunted with dashes of blue and purple light.
  </p>
  <p>
    Still sitting on the floor, Rory finds the necklace to now be in a permanent state of
    turquoise blue. From out of it emerges a blue/green blob that appears to be alive. The
    spirit floats around Rory, runs through his ginger head, and shakes him as if it is trying
    to tell him something. Rory is now not so scared of the situation and thinks: “What is
    this blob? What is it trying to say?”
